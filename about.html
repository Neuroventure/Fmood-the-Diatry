        <h1>Welcome to Fmood, the Diatry!</h1>
        <p>at Fmood we are dedicated to helping users cultivate mindfulness in their eating habits and capture their emotions towards it. We are passionate about the connection between what we consume and how it influences our overall well-being.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With a deep understanding of the mind-body relationship, we aim to provide a space where individuals can explore themselves in reflection towards their food and mood by noting them down. Our mission is to empower users with the ability to journal log their eating behaviors and the mood they felt while eating to help make more informed choices when it comes to their dietary habits, ultimately, promoting a healthier and aware lifestyle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We believe that by fostering mindfulness in how we eat, we can unlock the potential for positive transformations in both our physical and mental well-being. Join us, in this exciting adventure as we navigate the fascinating world of food and mood, together. Let's embark on a path towards greater self-awareness, nourishment, and happiness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our page, brought to you sincerely by Jeremiah Haynes, Justin Schultz, Salome Mphago, Sean Keller, and Kristion Kim</p>
